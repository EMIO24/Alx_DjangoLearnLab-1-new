    <div class="prose max-w-none text-gray-800 leading-relaxed">
        <p>This Privacy Policy describes how your personal information is collected, used, and shared when you visit or make use of this Django Blog (the "Site").</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-4">Personal Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>When you visit the Site, we automatically collect certain information about your device, including information about your web browser, IP address, time zone, and some of the cookies that are installed on your device. Additionally, as you browse the Site, we collect information about the individual web pages or products that you view, what websites or search terms referred you to the Site, and information about how you interact with the Site. We refer to this automatically-collected information as “Device Information.”</p>
        <p>We collect Device Information using the following technologies:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>“Cookies” are data files that are placed on your device or computer and often include an anonymous unique identifier. For more information about cookies, and how to disable cookies, visit <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org" class="text-blue-600 hover:underline">http://www.allaboutcookies.org</a>.</li>
            <li>“Log files” track actions occurring on the Site, and collect data including your IP address, browser type, Internet service provider, referring/exit pages, and date/time stamps.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Additionally, when you register for an account or leave a comment through the Site, we collect certain information from you, including your name, email address, and any content you choose to submit (like comments or post content). We refer to this information as “Order Information.”</p>
        <p>When we talk about “Personal Information” in this Privacy Policy, we are talking both about Device Information and Order Information.</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-4">How Do We Use Your Personal Information?</h2>
        <p>We use the Order Information that we collect generally to fulfill any interactions placed through the Site (including processing your registration, managing your posts and comments). Additionally, we use this Order Information to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Communicate with you;</li>
            <li>Screen our interactions for potential risk or fraud; and</li>
            <li>When in line with the preferences you have shared with us, provide you with information or advertising relating to our products or services.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We use the Device Information that we collect to help us screen for potential risk and fraud (in particular, your IP address), and more generally to improve and optimize our Site (for example, by generating analytics about how our customers browse and interact with the Site, and to assess the success of our marketing and advertising campaigns).</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-4">Sharing Your Personal Information</h2>
        <p>We do not share your Personal Information with third parties. We may share your Personal Information to comply with applicable laws and regulations, to respond to a subpoena, search warrant or other lawful request for information we receive, or to otherwise protect our rights.</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-4">Your Rights</h2>
        <p>If you are a European resident, you have the right to access personal information we hold about you and to ask that your personal information be corrected, updated, or deleted. If you would like to exercise this right, please contact us through the contact information below.</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-4">Data Retention</h2>
        <p>When you place an interaction through the Site, we will maintain your Order Information for our records unless and until you ask us to delete this information.</p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-8 mb-4">Changes</h2>
        <p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time in order to reflect, for example, changes to our practices or for other operational, legal or regulatory reasons.</p>
